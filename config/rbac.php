    | fallback.
    |
    | This is a temporary expand/contract rollout flag. It stays OFF until the
    | parity test is green and the legacy sources have been backfilled into
    | model_has_roles in every environment; only then is it switched on and the
    | legacy columns dropped (a later slice).
