/**
 * The FINANCE half of the drive fixture: given ENROLLMENT UUIDs (handed in from outside — this
 * class never touches Academics, per the arch boundary), it produces every money state by
 * executing the REAL Actions. Lives in App\Finance because only App\Finance may use the Finance
 * Actions; it is driven by the cross-module `SeedDriveFixture` command, which creates the
 * enrollments and passes their UUIDs in — exactly as production bills a UUID resolved through the
 * ACL port, never an enrollment it reached into Academics for.
 *
 * All methods assume the active-School context is already set by the caller and run within it.
